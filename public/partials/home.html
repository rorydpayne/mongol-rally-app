    <p>Rory & Jeremy will be riding beaten up motorbikes from the UK
        to Mongolia as part of the <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally/" target="_blank">Mongol Rally</a> in July.
        It's a 10,000 mile challenge through 17 countries and mixes remote deserts,
        open roads, high altitude mountain ranges and terrain which will rattle us to insanity.
        We'll be joined by close friends, Katlyn, Reuben & Pete who've
        opted for the slightly more sensible option of a car, but it's a Toyota Yaris.</p>

        <p>We're hoping to raise <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserProfilePage.action?userUrl=RoryandJeremy&isTeam=true" target="_blank">£2500 for Rowcroft Hospice</a>
            which is where Jeremy's mum spent her final few weeks, providing exceptional care for her and support
            to the family. Rowcroft is committed to helping every patient make the most of every moment by providing
            comfort, support and specialist care to over 2,200 patients and their loved ones across South Devon each
            year. The hospice’s services are provided without charge, but they are not without cost.
            Rowcroft does receive NHS funding, amounting to 23% of expenditure, leaving the hospice needing
            to raise £19,000 each day, 365 days a year, to provide its vital services.</p>

        <p>The rally is a challenge which we've been planning for months and are confident we'll make it to Mongolia.
            It'll be our toughest challenge to date along roads and tracks that aren't suitable for the best equipped
            vehicles, let alone a few knackered motorbikes.</p>
