    <h4>Charity</h4>
    <p>We are using the rally to help us raise money for 5 different charities: Cool Earth, Mind, Dementia UK,
        British Heart Foundation and Rowcroft Hospice. We’ve chosen these charities because we believe the work
        they do is incredible. We aim to raise £2,000 per charity and hope to run multiple fundraisers over the
        coming months – 100% of these fundraisers will go directly to the charities.</p>

        <p>Cool Earth is a UK-based international NGO that protects endangered rainforests in order to combat
            global warming, protect ecosystems and to provide employment for local people. It works alongside
            indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction. All Cool Earth partnerships are community owned and led.</p>

        <p>Mind offers information and advice to people with mental health problems, and lobbies government and local
            authorities on their behalf. It also works to raise public awareness and understanding of issues relating to
            mental health.</p>

        <p>Dementia UK provides support and guidance to those suffering from dementia – it helps them to live more
            positively and face the challenges it brings. Reuben's connection to this charity is particularly personal
            as Dementia UK have directly helped his grandparents who suffer from this disease.</p>

        <p>The British Heart Foundation funds research, education, care and awareness campaigns aimed to
            prevent heart diseases in humans. Coronary heart disease is the UK’s biggest killer and Pete’s
            granddad was sadly lost to a heart attack.</p>

        <p>Rowcroft Hospice is a wonderful Devon charity that provides care for 2,200 people each year. Jeremy's
            mum spent her final few weeks with Rowcroft - they're a fantastic organisation that make a massive
            difference to so many.</p>
